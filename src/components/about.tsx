          I&apos;m Muhammad Fareed, a full-stack developer from Pakistan with a
          strong passion for building modern, scalable applications. After
          completing my O-Levels at Zatians, I dedicated myself to mastering web
          and mobile development. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple,
          elegant solutions and bringing ideas to life through clean code and
          thoughtful design. My expertise covers React, Next.js, Angular,
          Node.js, Express, and databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I also
          have hands-on experience with Redux, React Native, Firebase, Supabase,
          and real-time technologies like Socket.IO.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m open to opportunities where I can contribute my skills, grow
          professionally, and work on impactful projects. If you&apos;re looking
          for a developer who can deliver quality and adapt quickly, feel free
          to reach out.
